# z2_matter_qc/main

The Jupyter notebook `Z2_Simulation_Main-03.24.22.ipynb` runs the latest version of the simulation.
This notebook will eventually be ported to a python script that will be run through the command line.
The `bash/zsh` script that automatically submits multiple jobs (to be written) will also live here. 

The program `Z2_Simulation_Main-03.24.22.ipynb` gets simulation inputs from `yaml` files in the `./inputs` folder,
uses functions defined in the `python` scripts in the `./modules` folder,
and saves the input, and output `json` files to the `./json` folder.
